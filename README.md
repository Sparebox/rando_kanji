# rando kanji
# A Japanese Kanji character guessing/learning application

Based loosely on spaced repetition. Kanji will be shown based on how well you remember them. If you don't know anything you just have to trial and error first. There will be four answer options shown for each Kanji. You can choose between the Kanji meaning or the pronunciation for the options. You can also choose between r≈çmaji and kana text for options. Supports three user profiles for different learning settings.
